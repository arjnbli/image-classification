# Deep Residual Network Implementation in TensorFlow

The code requires a path to the directory in which the tiny imagenet dataset is located. 
A 14 layer architecture is used instead of RESNET-18 because of the smaller size of images in tiny imagenet as compared to the full imagenet (64 X 64 vs 224 X 224).
